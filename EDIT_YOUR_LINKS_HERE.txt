🚀 FLIPSIDE QUICK-START: CUSTOMIZING YOUR LINKS
==========================

To update your website's social media, payment methods, and business info, 
simply edit the following file:

📂 File Path: js/brand-settings.js

In that file, you can enter:
✅ Discord Server Link
✅ TikTok / YouTube / Instagram Channel Links
✅ Linktree URL
✅ Bitcoin (BTC) & Ethereum (ETH) Wallet Addresses
✅ PayPal Client ID
✅ Business Email & Phone

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Always keep the quotes around your links (e.g., "https://discord.gg/...")
- If you leave a link empty (e.g., discord: ""), it will automatically be hidden from the website.
- Save the file and refresh your browser to see the changes!
